# detrend_force
This function was created in an effort to correct any drift in a force-measuring treadmill signal when someone is running on it. When running, a person has only 1 foot on the ground at a time, with an aerial phase inbetween. This function assumes that the force measured by the treadmill during any given aerial phase should be zero, and uses the aerial phases before and after a given step to tare the force signal. This will effectively correct for drift in the signal step-by-step.
