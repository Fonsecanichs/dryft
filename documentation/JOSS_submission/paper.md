# Background
Ground reaction forces (GRFs) are exerted by the body on the ground during running, measured by treadmills instrumented
with force transducers, and are used to calculate a variety of clinical and performance-related biomechanical variables
[Kram et al 1998]. However, force transducer signals can be affected by changes in temperature during warm up or over long periods
[Sloot et al. 2015], causing the signal to drift. If ignored, signal drift causes inaccuracies in the calculation of
biomechanical variables. For example, ground contact time is defined as the time the foot is in contact with the ground and is often
calculated as the time a vertical GRF exceeds a threshold. Drift changes the amount of the vertical GRF
signal to fall below the threshold, affecting the calculation of time-dependent GRF metrics. Drift can also potentially lead
to data loss if the signal exceeds the range of the force transducer.

To prospectively counteract signal drift, it is best practice to zero (tare) the force transducers between trials
during data collection. However, zeroing force transducers may not be feasible for protocols requiring extended periods
of continuous running on an instrumented treadmill, which could result in GRF signals drifting over time. There are
signal processing methods available to remove a constant offset [v3d documentation] or linear drift [detrend function
documentation] in GRF signals, but their effectiveness is limited because signal drift may not be linear over the
duration of the trial. Here I introduce `dryft`, an open source Python and MATLAB package that takes a simple
approach to identifying and correcting non-linear drift in GRF signals produced during treadmill running.

# Summary
During the aerial phase of running, the body exerts no force on the ground. `dryft` assumes that any ground
reaction force measured during an aerial phase is due to noise or signal drift. `dryft` uses a force threshold
(user-defined) to approximate the start and end of each stance phase and identify aerial and stance phases in a
filtered vertical GRF signal (Figure 1). Then the force measured by the instrumented treadmill during the middle of each aerial
phase is identified. The middle value of each aerial phase is identified to avoid the possibility that part of the
adjacent stance phases are included in the drift estimation process. These aerial phase values are then cubic spline
interpolated to the full length of the GRF signal. These interpolated values represent the underlying drift in the GRF
signal and are subtracted, producing the corrected vertical GRF signal (Figure 1). Once aerial phases have been
identified using the vertical GRF signal, this process can be applied to horizontal GRF signals as well.

To test the performance of this method, I added drift to a 30-second vertical GRF signal collected by an instrumented
treadmill during running (Fukuchi et al 2017). Using `dryft` to reduce this signalâ€™s drift produced favorable results, as
the average force measured across aerial phases was 0.01 N for the corrected signal (Figure 2). While `dryft` was
intended to be used with GRF signals measured during treadmill running, it could also be applied to split-belt walking
GRF signals as well, as typically only one foot is on a belt at a time. However, extra care should be taken to identify crossover steps
prior to correcting drift, as they will influence the accuracy of the force values measured during the swing phase.

# Conclusion
Prior work corrects non-linear drift in GRF signals by subtracting the mean force measured during a given
aerial phase from the following stance phase [Sloot2015, Paolini2007]. The success of this method heavily relies on how
accurately stance and aerial phases are identified and assumes that there is no change in drift within a given step
(consecutive aerial and stance phases). Instead, `dryft` interpolates the force measured at the middle of each aerial
phase and subtracts this from the entire trial. This package can be used to identify stance phases and correct
non-linear drift in ground reaction force signals produced during treadmill running or split-belt walking.
