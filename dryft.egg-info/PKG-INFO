        This library was created in an effort to correct any drift in a force-measuring 
        treadmill or force plate signal when someone is running on it. When running, a 
        person has only 1 foot on the ground at a time, with an aerial phase inbetween each step. 
        Here, I assume that the force measured by the treadmill during any given aerial phase should be zero, 
        and use the aerial phases before and after a given step to tare the force signal. This will 
        effectively correct for drift in the signal step-wise manner. 
        
        The python library was developed first and has been tested . A MATLAB version was
        created afterwards as it is a common language used in the field of biomechanics.
